# Poor humans cloud homelab

## Hardware
Raspberry Pi (2 and/or 3)

## Wishlist
* Have a "reset" thing, that sets the lab back to some kind of factory default
    * kinda wonkily working with the reset-lab playbook
* Deploy and run k8s on raspi cluster
* Deploy bosh director so you can deploy bosh releases (maybe CF craziness in the
  future

## Known issues
* Not everything is as idempotent as i'd like it to be yet
